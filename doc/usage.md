# Usage

The inputs to tree-crasher are a corpus of files and a command to run. By
default, tree-crasher passes inputs to the command on stdin, but will replace
the special symbol `@@` with a filename as seen in the examples above.

tree-crasher saves inputs that match a set of conditions. By default the only
condition is that the target receives an unhandled signal (e.g., a segfault).
Extra conditions may be added with the `--interesting*` flags, see `--help`.

tree-crasher does not exit gracefully at the moment; just send SIGINT (ctrl-c)
when you're done fuzzing.

## Examples

When reading these examples, keep in mind that fuzzing can cause unpredictable
behaviors. Always fuzz in a VM or Docker container with a memory limit, no
network access, and no important files.

### JavaScript interpreters

Obtain a collection of JavaScript files and put them in `corpus/` (for example,
using [this script](../scripts/corpora/js.sh)). Then here's how to fuzz
[JerryScript][jerryscript] and [Boa][boa]:

```sh
tree-crasher-javascript corpus/ jerry
tree-crasher-javascript corpus/ boa
```

(By default, tree-crasher passes input to the target on stdin.)

### Python's regex engine

Write `rx.py` like so:
```python
import re
import sys
try:
    s = sys.stdin.read()
    r = re.compile(s)
    print(r.match(s))
except:
    pass
```

Put some sample regular expressions in `corpus/`. Then:
```sh
tree-crasher-regex corpus/ -- python3 $PWD/rx.py
```

### rustc

tree-crasher has found many bugs in rustc. Here's how it was done! The special
`@@` symbol on the command line gets replaced by the file generated by
tree-crasher.

```sh
tree-crasher-rust \
  --interesting-stderr "(?m)^error: internal compiler error:" \
  corpus \
  -- \
  rustc +nightly --crate-type=lib --emit=mir -Zmir-opt-level=4 @@.rs
```

(The regex syntax is that of the
[regex crate](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/).)

Here's how to limit the amount of memory taken by tree-crasher and rustc using
`systemd-run`, and drop network access using `unshare`:

```sh
systemd-run --scope -p MemoryMax=16G -p MemorySwapMax=0B --user \
  unshare -Umn \
  tree-crasher-rust \
    --interesting-stderr "(?m)^error: internal compiler error:" \
    corpus \
    -- \
    rustc +nightly --crate-type=lib --emit=mir -Zmir-opt-level=4 @@.rs
```

### SQL databases

Obtain a collection of SQL files (for example, using
[this script](../scripts/corpora/sql.sh)). Then here's how to fuzz DuckDB:

```sh
tree-crasher-sql --interesting-stderr "INTERNAL Error" corpus/ -- duckdb
```

Sometimes, you keep running into the same bug and would like to stop reporting
it. For that, you can use `--uninteresting-stderr`:
```sh
tree-crasher-sql \
  --interesting-stderr "INTERNAL Error" \
  --uninteresting-stderr "INTERNAL Error.+HyperLogLog::ComputeHashes" \
  corpus \
  -- \
  duckdb
```

## Even more examples

Clang (frontend) (see also [this script](../scripts/corpora/c.sh)):

```sh
tree-crasher-c corpus/ --interesting-stderr "(?m)^PLEASE " -- clang -c -O0 -o /dev/null -emit-llvm -Xclang -disable-llvm-passes @@.c
```

[`deno fmt`](https://deno.land/manual@v1.31.3/tools/formatter):
```sh
tree-crasher-javascript corpus/ -- deno fmt @@.js
```

[ClickHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse):
```sh
tree-crasher-sql corpus/ -- clickhouse local
```
